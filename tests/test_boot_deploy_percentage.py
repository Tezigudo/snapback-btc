"""The boot line must not read a deposit as profit.

Regression cover for 2026-09-09. `deploy_start_equity` is a RAW equity snapshot
frozen when the leg first booted, so every later deposit moves the numerator
and leaves the denominator behind. sol_supertrend booted announcing

    Resuming deploy. start=60.00 current=73.71 (+22.85%)

on a leg that was DOWN 7.9%: $60 was deployed on 25 Jul and another $20 funded
on 28 Aug, so $80 went in and $73.71 came back. This is the same two-clocks
defect PR #25 fixed in monitor.py, and it errs in the flattering direction --
the one that talks you out of looking.

The fix reports against P (principal_base + Sigma USDT ledger), which is the
denominator `_check_kill_switch` already names, so the boot line and the
kill-switch line can no longer describe the same leg differently.
