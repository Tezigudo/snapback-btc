"""Restart ONE snapback leg, but only while it is provably flat and clean.

    ./.venv/bin/python /root/snapback-btc/tools/leg_safe_restart.py <instance>

WHY THIS EXISTS. boot() FLATTENS any open position in live mode, so restarting
a leg mid-trade silently closes it at market. /root/v1_deferred_restart.py
enforced that check for v1 only -- donchian and sol_supertrend had no sanctioned
path at all, so they got raw `systemctl restart`, which performs no check
whatsoever. This generalises the v1 guard to every leg.

FLAT means all three, checked against the EXCHANGE, not the local DB:
  - position side == flat
  - zero plain open orders
  - zero resting ALGO orders  (SL/TP live on /fapi/v1/openAlgoOrders, which
    fetch_open_orders does NOT return -- the blind spot behind the July -4045
    spam. Checking only plain orders would call "flat" with a bracket resting.)
An UNREADABLE algo book is treated as "unknown", never as "clean".

Also fixes a real footgun in the v1 script: it logged a HARDCODED target commit
("restarting onto 8bbe584") that had gone stale, so its output claimed a deploy
that was not what was on disk. Here the target is read from git at run time.

On anything unexpected: do nothing and leave the bot alone.

EXIT CODES are deliberately distinct, because "I safely did nothing" and "I may
have just broken a real-money leg" must never share a code:
    0  restarted and healthy   (or, with --check, the leg IS restartable)
    1  RESTARTED BUT NOT ACTIVE -- needs a human NOW
    2  usage error
    3  refused; the bot was NOT touched (in position, orders resting, or the
       algo book could not be read).  This is the SAFE outcome.

RACE: a leg could open a position between the flat check and the restart, and
boot() would then flatten it. Mitigated by RE-VERIFYING position and both order
books immediately before `systemctl restart`, which cuts the window from the
several seconds the exchange round-trips take down to one syscall. It is not
eliminated -- doing that would need the bot to stop producing orders first, and
`systemctl stop` then finding the leg NOT flat would strand an open position
with no supervising process, which is strictly worse than refusing while it
runs. Narrowed and disclosed, deliberately not closed.

Usage:
    tools/leg_safe_restart.py <instance>          restart if flat
    tools/leg_safe_restart.py <instance> --check report only, never restart
