"""Principal anchor for the kill switch (God's rule: protect DEPOSITED PRINCIPAL).

The kill switch trips at `equity < P * kill_fraction`, where P = NET DEPOSITED
PRINCIPAL — NOT a high-water mark and NOT a balance snapshot. P is built purely
from Binance USDM-futures income-ledger events of type TRANSFER (signed):

    P = principal_base + Σ(USDT principal-moving income)

Trading income (REALIZED_PNL, FUNDING_FEE, COMMISSION) is EXCLUDED, so bot P&L
never moves P. A spot->futures DCA (positive TRANSFER) RAISES P; a withdrawal
(negative TRANSFER) LOWERS P.

Idempotency (the reason a wrong-account over-read can never corrupt the anchor
the way a balance snapshot could): every principal-moving income event is stored
in `state.principal_ledger` keyed by its stable Binance `tranId` (PRIMARY KEY,
INSERT OR IGNORE). P is DERIVED as SUM over the ledger, so re-fetching an
overlapping income window on restart cannot double-count.

Initialisation — REQUIRED CORRECTION: NEVER snapshot current balance (that bakes
trading profit into principal, violating the rule). Two seeds only:
  - manual mode      : deploy.manual_principal_usdt in params → principal_base =
                       that value, no history backfill (watermark starts at now,
                       future transfers still accumulate on top).
  - income_backfill  : (default) principal_base = 0, full-history income backfill
                       into the ledger. P = Σ ledger.

Validated 2026-07-01 (read-only, donchian sub-account): spot->futures transfers
appear as incomeType=TRANSFER, asset USDT, each with a stable tranId; no
REALIZED_PNL/FUNDING/COMMISSION contamination in the transfer set.
